## Description

Αrticle Processing Charges (APCs) capture the affordability and accessibility of Open Access publishing for different types of stakeholders, such as researchers, institutions, and funding agencies. It is also relevant for policy-makers seeking to optimize Open Science policies.

Tracking and comparing APCs could also be used to encourage publishers to adopt more transparent and equitable APC pricing policies and support the development of sustainable Open Access publishing models accessible to all researchers regardless of their financial resources.

APCs have both benefits and drawbacks. In countries where funder reimbursement of APC costs or transformative agreements do not cover these costs, APCs can create a financial barrier that limits access to Open Access journals. On the other hand, APCs also incentivize publishers to offer Open Access publishing, which promotes Open Science.

## Metrics

### Number of publications with an APC cost

This metric measures the number of research articles published in journals and have incurred an APC.

Limitation:

-   Not knowing who incurred that APC (funder, institution, author, etc.) limits the usefulness of this indicator.

#### Measurement.

##### Datasources

###### OpenAIRE Graph

The OpenAIRE graph (graph.openaire.eu)\*\

-   OpenAIRE does not yet have OA colors (Green OA, Gold OA, etc.) as part of its dump yet, but it is expected before the end of PathOS.

Via OpenAIRE MONITOR

1.  Take all Gold OA publications from OpenAIRE (i.e. those published in a fully OA journal), remove those that are also Diamond OA (i.e. no APC). The remaining are Gold OA publications that paid an APC.
2.  Add to the set Hybrid and Bronze OA publications (also incur an APC)
3.  Use the APCs in OpenAIRE (from OpenAPC – openapc.net) to verify that there are no additional publications that have incurred an APC that are not already counted.
4.  Count the number of number of result OA publications that incurred an APC

Notes:

-   Is it true that all Hybrid and Bronze OA publications incurred an APC?

Limitations:

-   This methodology is a workaround chosen as it provides better coverage than any APC dataset we are aware of, however it is not a direct source of whether a publication has incurred an APC or not.

### % Publications with an APC

This metric measures the percentage of research articles published in Open Access that require payment of an Article Processing Charge (APC) and it provides a more nuanced understanding of the affordability and accessibility of Open Access publishing than the "Number of publications with an APC " metric. This metric can be used to compare the affordability and accessibility of Open Access publishing across different journals, publishers, and regions in a more meaningful way.

Limitations:

-   This metric could be more useful when put together with % Diamond OA publications, as opposed to stand alone.
-   Not knowing who incurred that APC (funder, institution, author, etc.) limits the usefulness of this metric.

#### Measurement.

##### Datasources

###### OpenAIRE Graph

The OpenAIRE graph (graph.openaire.eu)\*\

-   OpenAIRE does not yet have OA colors (Green OA, Gold OA, etc.) as part of its dump yet, but it is expected before the end of PathOS.

Via OpenAIRE MONITOR

1.  Take all Gold OA publications from OpenAIRE (i.e. those published in a fully OA journal), remove those that are also Diamond OA (i.e. no APC). The remaining are Gold OA publications that paid an APC.
2.  Add to the set Hybrid and Bronze OA publications (also incur an APC)
3.  Use the APCs in OpenAIRE (from OpenAPC – openapc.net) to verify that there are no additional publications that have incurred an APC that are not already counted.
4.  This set contains the OA publications that incurred an APC, use the set of all OA publications at your level of interest (e.g. country) to calculate the share.

Limitations:

-   Same as II.2

### Average APC

Description:

The "average APC" metric measures the average cost of Article Processing Charges (APCs) across a defined level of interest (per year, country, organization, etc.).

Usefulness:

The "average APC" metric can help assess the affordability and accessibility of Open Access publishing. It provides a broad understanding of the cost of Open Access publishing and identifies trends and changes in APC pricing over time. This metric can help researchers, institutions, and funding agencies to compare the cost-effectiveness of different Open Access publishing models and identify affordable publishing options.

Limitations:

-   The cost of APCs can vary widely depending on the field of research, the region, and the specific publisher or journal, therefore taking an average may be misleading.
-   Not knowing who incurred that APC (funder, institution, author, etc.) limits the usefulness of this metric.

#### Measurement.

##### Datasources

###### OpenAIRE Graph

The OpenAPC APC dataset, which is integrated in the OpenAIRE graph (graph.openaire.eu)

Limitations:

-   Incomplete data: Publishers do not generally provide data on their APC fees, OpenAPC has a growing collection but it is not complete.
-   In an (organization, publication, APC cost) triplet it is not possible to distinguish if the APC cost is the entire cost of the publication or just the what the organization paid.

Via OpenAIRE MONITOR

1.  Identify the unit of analysis (e.g. average APCs for an institution)
2.  Examine the coverage of APCs for the relevant publications (see metric Number of OA publications with APC).
3.  Examine if the coverage is adequate and the distribution of costs meaningful for taking an average.
4.  Take the average APC for that level of analysis.

Limitations:

-   Averages have the benefit of summarizing and normalizing information, however depending on the underlying distribution of costs, they may be misleading (e.g. via outliers)

### Total APC

Description:

The "Total APC" metric measures the total cost of Article Processing Charges (APCs) for a defined level of interest (per year, country, organization, etc.)

Usefulness:

The "total APC" metric can help assess the affordability and accessibility of Open Access publishing. It provides a broad understanding of the cost of Open Access publishing and identifies trends and changes in APC pricing over time. By summing the APCs this metric measures the total financial burden of OA publishing for the unit of analysis and can be compared to other aggregate measures.

Limitations:

-   Not knowing who incurred that APC (funder, institution, author, etc.) limits the usefulness of this metric, more than the previous ones.
-   It does not contain information of the distribution of APCs across a subdomain, e.g. Total cost does not give info on how it is distributed across scientific domains.

#### Measurement.

###### OpenAIRE Graph

The OpenAPC APC dataset, which is integrated in the OpenAIRE graph (graph.openaire.eu)

Limitations:

-   Incomplete data: Publishers do not generally provide data on their APC fees, OpenAPC has a growing collection but it is not complete.
-   In an (organization, publication, APC cost) triplet it is not possible to distinguish if the APC cost is the entire cost of the publication or just the what the organization paid.

Via OpenAIRE MONITOR

1.  Identify the unit of analysis (e.g. total APCs for an institution)
2.  Examine the coverage of APCs for the relevant publications (see metric Number of OA publications with APC).
3.  Examine if the coverage is adequate.
4.  Sum the APCs for that level of analysis.

Limitations:

-   Totals have the benefit of giving a bird’s eye view, however depending on the underlying distribution of costs, they can have different implications.

## Notes

We conducted an APC extrapolation exercise that may be useful here, what do you think?
