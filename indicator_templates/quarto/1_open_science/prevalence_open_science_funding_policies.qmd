## Description

This indicator aims to capture the prevalence of funding being provided
for open science. It is closely related to the indicator for prevalence
of national policies for Open Science. Since Open Science can be
considered a catch-all term for different practices and objectives, this
may include different elements or distinct policies such as open access
to publications, open data, fair data, research assessment reform,
citizen science etc. Usually, the question whether funding is provided
is part of a policy. I.e., the availability of funding implies the
existence of a policy as well.

Practically, funding might be available at various levels. It can be
internationally, nationally, regionally, institutionally (RPOs, HEIs,
RFOs etc.) or even department or institute dependent.

Knowing the existence of funding can be helpful to evaluate if …

## Metrics

### \<Investments in Open Science Research Infrastructures\>

The metric is to provide the overview of
the<span id="_Int_0uJu4pci"></span> sum of capital investments policy
making bodies on the international/national/regional levels into related
Research Infrastructures. The investment can be of CAPEX (capital
expenditure) or OPEX (operational expenses) qualities and is to describe
the financial commitment of governing bodies in executing related OS
policies. The limitation of the metric derives from the complexity on
what to include as financial investment in OS infrastructure, therefore
the related national formuli can be varied which makes the comparison
somewhat problematic as there is no consensus what a distinguished
OS-related investment means therefore what R\&I investments to consider
when calculating the investent levels. Currently there are ongoing
discussions within Europe to clarify these within the framework of EOSC
Observatory and EOSC Steering Board that consist of Member States and
Associated Countries.

Please describe how we could measure the proposed metric. What are
potential measurement problems and limitations? Please also explain the
difficulty of obtaining this measurement, and identify gaps in existing
possibilities for measurement. If there are already existing datasources
and/or methodologies, these can be described in more detail below. If no
datasources or methodologies exist yet, please indicate this.

##### Existing datasources: https://zenodo.org/communities/eoscobservatory/?page=1\&size=20

###### \<EOSC Observatory\>

The datasource has a special focus on EOSC related investments which is
the backbone of the European infrastructure of OS. It directly gathers
data from Member States and Associated Countries on a yearly basis
through individual surveys and then in-depth interviews within the
frames of the EOSC Future project. After 2023 September, the information
gathering activity is questionnable.

##### Existing methodologies

###### \<methodology name\>

Several related publications can be found in the EOSC Observatory’s
Zenodo channel, however it is important to mention that methodologies
differ case by case and there are only overarching recommendations to
member states and associated countries. This is an ongoing and
pioneering activity to enhance the alignment of different countries with
different structures. Therefore, the used methodologies and formuli are
not standardised yet but the recommendations contain the following
criteria:

  - To include OPEX, CAPEX
  - To fix a given percentage of Research infrastructure related
    investments to have an estimated share of OS-related investments
    from those

## Known correlates

NA

## Notes

This is an ongoing process that needs time until it can be considered as
elaborated.
