## Description

Description:

-   The "availability of preprint repositories" indicator measures the
    availability and accessibility of preprint repositories that are
    available to researchers in a particular level of interest such as
    field, country or organization.

Usefulness:

-   The "availability of preprint repositories" indicator provides
    insight into the infrastructure and resources available to
    researchers for sharing their work as preprints.
-   It can help to identify areas where preprint repositories are
    lacking or where access to these repositories is limited,
    potentially hindering the adoption of preprinting practices.
-   This indicator can also be used to assess the impact of preprint
    repositories on scholarly communication and to identify areas where
    additional resources and support may be needed.

Limitations:

-   Not all fields or research areas may have a culture of preprinting,
    which can affect the applicability of the indicator in different
    contexts.
-   There may be good preprint practices in general repositories (such
    as Zenodo) that would not be identifiable via this indicator.

## Metrics

### Number of preprint repositoriesW

Description:

-   The "number of preprint repositories" indicator measures the
    quantity of preprint repositories available to researchers in a
    particular field, country, organization, etc.

Usefulness:

-   See indicator description.

Limitations:

-   See indicator description.

#### Measurement.

Count

##### Existing datasources:

###### &lt;datasource name&gt;

Unknown, via literature review?

##### Existing methodologies

###### &lt;methodology name&gt;

Unknown, via literature review?

1.  Identify preprint repositories (how?)
2.  Classify them thematically or geographically and by size and scope
    to make meaningful comparisons

## Known correlates

We do not know for sure but we assume the following:

1.  Scientific field
2.  Country (better OS infrastructure?)
