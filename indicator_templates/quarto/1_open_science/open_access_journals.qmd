## Description

Description:

-   The "OA journals" indicator measures the availability of *fully* Open Access (OA) journals for a particular level of interest (e.g. research area, year, etc.). An Open Access journal is a scholarly journal that is freely available online and does not charge readers or institutions for access to its content.

Usefulness:

-   The "OA journals" indicator provides insight into the availability of infrastructure and uptake of Open Science.
-   It can help to identify scientific areas (for example) where OA journals are lacking or where access to these journals is limited, potentially hindering the adoption of OA publishing practices.
-   This indicator can also be used to assess the impact of OA publishing on scholarly communication and to identify areas where additional resources and support may be needed.

Limitations:

-   The "OA journals" indicator has limitations because it does not account for the quality or peer-review process of the OA journals, which can vary widely.
-   Not all fields or research areas may have a culture of OA publishing, which can affect the comparison of the indicator across different contexts.
-   This indicator also does not account for other forms of OA publishing, such as OA monographs or book chapters, which can also play a role in the dissemination of research findings.

## Metrics

### Number of OA Journals

Description:

-   The "number of OA journals" metric measures the quantity of Open Access (OA) journals available to researchers

Usefulness:

-   Same as in indicator description.

Limitations:

-   Same as in indicator description.
-   The number itself is not necessarily meaningful as an absolute.

#### Measurement.

The total number of OA journals available.

##### Datasources

###### OpenAIRE Graph

The OpenAIRE Graph ingests DOAJ.

1.  Identify all doaj journals in OpenAIRE (datasource)

Fully OA journals

2.  Count them.

### Number of Gold/Hybrid/Diamond Journals

**Diamond OS has to do with the APC business model of the journal.**

**Fully/Gold OA journals can be Diamond (no APC) or with APC therefore we would have indicators by Journal Business Model**

-   **Fully OA (Gold), Hybrid, Transformative**

**And by APC Journal Business Model**

-   **Diamond, Gold with APCs, Hybrid or sth like that**

**See here plz: https://monitor.openaire.eu/methodology/terminology\#constructed-attributes**
