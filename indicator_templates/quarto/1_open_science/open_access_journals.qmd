## Description

Description:

-   The "OA journals" indicator measures the availability of *fully*
    open access (OA) journals for a particular level of interest (e.g.
    research area, year, etc.). An open access journal is a scholarly
    journal that is freely available online and does not charge readers
    or institutions for access to its content.

Usefulness:

-   The "OA journals" indicator provides insight into the availability
    of infrastructure and uptake of Open Science.
-   It can help to identify scientific areas (for example) where OA
    journals are lacking or where access to these journals is limited,
    potentially hindering the adoption of OA publishing practices.
-   This indicator can also be used to assess the impact of OA
    publishing on scholarly communication and to identify areas where
    additional resources and support may be needed.

Limitations:

-   The "OA journals" indicator has limitations because it does not
    account for the quality or peer-review process of the OA journals,
    which can vary widely.
-   Not all fields or research areas may have a culture of OA
    publishing, which can affect the comparison of the indicator across
    different contexts.
-   This indicator also does not account for other forms of OA
    publishing, such as OA monographs or book chapters, which can also
    play a role in the dissemination of research findings.

## Metrics

### Number of OA Journals

Description:

-   The "number of OA journals" metric measures the quantity of open
    access (OA) journals available to researchers

Usefulness:

-   Same as in indicator description.

Limitations:

-   Same as in indicator description.
-   The number itself is not necessarily meaningful as an absolute.

#### Measurement.

The total number of OA journals available.

##### Existing datasources:

###### OpenAIRE Graph

The OpenAIRE Graph ingests DOAJ.

##### Existing methodologies

###### &lt;methodology name&gt;

1.  Identify all doaj journals in OpenAIRE (datasource)

fully OA journals

1.  Count them.

### Number of Gold/Hybrid/Diamond Journals

**Diamond OS has to do with the APC business model of the journal.**

**Fully/Gold OA journals can be Diamond (no APC) or with APC therefore
we would have indicators by Journal Business Model**

-   **Fully OA (Gold), Hybrid, Transformative**

**And by APC Journal Business Model**

-   **Diamond, Gold with APCs, Hybrid or sth like that**
