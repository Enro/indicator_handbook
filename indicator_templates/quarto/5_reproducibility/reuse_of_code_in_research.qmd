## Description

The reuse of code or software in research refers to the practice of
utilizing existing code or software to develop new research tools,
methods, or applications. It is becoming increasingly important in
various scientific fields, including computer science, engineering, and
data analysis, as it can enhance scientific reproducibility, improve
research efficiency, and foster collaborations between researchers. This
indicator aims to capture the extent to which researchers engage in the
reuse of code or software in their research, by quantifying the number
and proportion of studies that utilize existing code or software. The
indicator can be used to assess the level of collaboration and sharing
of resources within a specific scientific community or field, and to
identify potential barriers or incentives for the reuse of code or
software in research. Additionally, it can serve as a measure of the
quality and reliability of research, as the reuse of code or software
can increase the transparency, replicability, and scalability of
research findings.

## Metrics

### Number of code/software reused in publications

This metric quantifies the number of times existing code or software has
been reused in published research articles. A higher number of instances
of code or software reuse in publications indicates a higher level of
scientific collaboration and sharing of resources within a scientific
community or field.

A limitation of this metric is that it may not capture all instances of
code or software reuse, as some researchers may reuse code or software
without explicitly citing the original source. Additionally, this metric
may not account for the quality or appropriateness of the reused code or
software for the new research questions. Furthermore, it may be
challenging to compare the number of instances of code or software reuse
in publications across different fields, as some fields may rely more
heavily on developing new code or software rather than reusing existing
resources.

#### Measurement.

To measure the number of instances of code or software reuse found in
publications, automatic text mining and machine learning techniques can
be used to search for code or software reuse statements, or to identify
reused code or software within published research articles, such as the
work in PathOS Task 2.5.

However, these methods may face challenges such as inconsistencies in
reporting of code or software reuse, variations in the degree of
specificity in reporting of the reuse, and difficulties in
distinguishing between code or software that is reused versus code or
software that is developed anew but shares similarities with existing
code or software. Furthermore, the availability and quality of such
automated tools may vary across different research fields and may
require domain-specific adaptations.

##### Existing methodologies

###### PathOS work in Task 2.5

This is an automated tool used to identify code/software mentioned in
the text of publications and extract metadata associated with them, such
as name, version, license, etc. This tool can also classify whether the
code/software has been reused by the authors of the publication.

To measure the number of code/software reused in publications, the tool
can be used to identify the reused datasets in those publications.

### Number (%) of publications with reused code/software

This metric quantifies the number or percentage of publications that
explicitly mention the reuse of existing code or software. It provides
an indication of the extent to which researchers are utilizing existing
resources to develop new research tools, methods, or applications,
within a specific scientific field or task.

A limitation of this metric is that it may not capture all instances of
code or software reuse, as some researchers may reuse code or software
without explicitly citing the original source. Additionally, it may not
account for the quality or appropriateness of the reused code or
software for the new research questions. Furthermore, it may be
challenging to compare the number or percentage of publications with
reused code or software across different fields, as some fields may rely
more heavily on developing new code or software rather than reusing
existing resources.
