## Description

The polarity of publications refers to the overall sentiment expressed
in research publications, and can be used as an indicator of the
scientific community's perception of a certain topic or concept. This
indicator aims to capture the extent to which research publications
express supporting, refuting or neutral stance towards the claim,
methodology, results or research output of another publication. The
polarity of publications can be used to assess the impact of research on
a particular topic, identify potential controversies, and inform future
research directions.

The polarity of publications is also useful in assessing the impact of
reproducibility efforts in research. For instance, if publications that
report on successfully reproduced studies have a more positive polarity
than those that do not, this could indicate that reproducibility efforts
have a positive impact on the perception of the scientific community
towards a certain topic. Additionally, if there is a trend of negative
polarity towards studies that have failed to be reproduced, this could
suggest that reproducibility efforts have led to greater scrutiny and
higher standards for research quality.

## Metrics

### Number of supporting citations for publications

This metric counts the number of citations in which a publication is
cited in a way that supports its claims, methodology, results, or
research output. It can be used to determine the level of support a
publication has received from other researchers and can be indicative of
the scientific community's perception of the publication.

Limitations of this metric include the potential for biased or
incomplete citation practices, as well as the possibility that a
publication may receive support from researchers who share similar
viewpoints or research interests, rather than from a wider scientific
community.

#### Measurement.

To measure the number of supporting citations for a publication, we can
search for citations that explicitly mention the publication's claims,
methodology, results, or research output in a supportive way. Besides
manually searching for citations, extracting, and classifying their
mentions, which can be very time-consuming, we can leverage the OpenAIRE
Graph and utilize automated tools such as the PathOS work in Task 2.5
tool to extract the citation graph of the relevant publications and
identify the supporting citation mentions (hereinafter referred to as
‘citances’) from their text.

One potential limitation of this metric is that it may be difficult to
differentiate between citations that provide explicit support for a
publication's claims and those that merely mention the publication in
passing. In addition, not all citations may explicitly mention the
publication's claims, methodology, results or research outputs, and some
researchers may support a publication without necessarily citing it.

##### Existing methodologies

###### PathOS work in Task 2.5

This is a methodology for analyzing a publication's text and identifying
all citances to other publications. It then classifies these citances
based on their intent (generic, reuse, comparison), polarity
(supporting, refuting, neutral), and semantics (claim, methodology,
results, artifact/output).

Limitations of the tool include potential errors in capturing all
relevant citances, and correctly classifying their polarity.

###### OpenAIRE Research Graph

OpenAIRE Research Graph is a metadata infrastructure that provides a
gateway to research publications and their associated data. It is
possible to create citation graphs for publications using the OpenAIRE
Research Graph by accessing and analyzing the metadata provided by the
infrastructure.

Using the OpenAIRE Research Graph, it is possible to identify other
publications that have cited a publication of interest. The PathOS work
in Task 2.5 tool can then be applied to these citations to determine the
level of support towards the publication.

There are some limitations to the OpenAIRE Research Graph, such as
incomplete or missing metadata, which can affect the accuracy of the
citation graphs created. Additionally, the OpenAIRE Research Graph is
limited to grant-supported research publications, which may not include
all publications in each scientific field.
