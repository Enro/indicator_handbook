## Description

The reuse of data in research refers to the practice of utilizing
existing data sets for new research questions. It is a common practice
in various scientific fields, and it can lead to increased scientific
efficiency, reduced costs, and enhanced scientific collaborations. This
indicator aims to capture the extent to which researchers engage in the
reuse of data in their research, by quantifying the number and
proportion of studies that utilize previously collected data. The
indicator can be used to assess the level of scientific collaboration
and sharing of data within a specific scientific community or field, and
to identify potential barriers or incentives for the reuse of data in
research. Additionally, it can serve as a measure of the quality and
reliability of research, as the reuse of data can increase the
transparency, validity, and replicability of research findings.

## Metrics

### Number of datasets reused in publications

This metric quantifies the number of datasets that have been reused in
published research articles. A higher number of datasets reused in
publications indicates a higher level of scientific collaboration and
sharing of data within a scientific community or field.

A limitation of this metric is that it may not capture all instances of
data reuse, as some researchers may reuse data sets without explicitly
citing the original source. Additionally, this metric may not account
for the quality or appropriateness of the reused data sets for the new
research questions. Furthermore, it may be challenging to compare the
number of datasets reused in publications across different fields, as
some fields may rely more heavily on new data collection rather than
data reuse.

#### Measurement.

To measure the number of reused datasets found in publications,
automatic text mining and machine learning techniques can be used to
search for data reuse statements, data availability statements, or
directly extract the datasets from a publication and classify them as
reused, such as the work in PathOS Task 2.5.

However, these methods may face challenges such as inconsistencies in
reporting of reused data, and variations in the degree of specificity in
the reporting of the reuse. Additionally, the availability and quality
of such data extraction tools may vary across different research fields
and may require domain-specific adaptations.

##### Existing methodologies

###### PathOS work in Task 2.5

This is an automated tool used to identify datasets mentioned in the
text of publications and extract metadata associated with them, such as
name, version, license, etc. This tool can also classify whether the
dataset has been reused by the authors of the publication.

To measure the number of datasets reused in publications, the tool can
be used to identify the reused datasets in those publications.

### Number (%) of publications with reused datasets

This metric quantifies the number or percentage of publications that
explicitly mention the reuse of previously collected datasets. It is a
useful metric for assessing the extent to which researchers are engaging
in the reuse of data in their research, within a specific scientific
field or task.

A limitation of this metric is that it may not capture all instances of
data reuse, as some researchers may reuse data sets without explicitly
citing the original source. Additionally, it may not account for the
quality or appropriateness of the reused data sets for the new research
questions. Furthermore, it may be challenging to compare the number or
percentage of publications with reused datasets across different fields,
as some fields may rely more heavily on new data collection rather than
data reuse.
